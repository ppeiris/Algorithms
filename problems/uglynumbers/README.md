Example: 147 = 3 x 7 x 7

prime factors of 147 are {3, 7, 7}

**Supper Ugly Numbers** of 147 are {3^(n) x 7^(m) x 7^(k)}, n,m,k are positive integers

Note:

(1) 1 is a super ugly number for any given primes.

(2) The given numbers in primes are in ascending order.


**Question**: Find the nth super ugly number
